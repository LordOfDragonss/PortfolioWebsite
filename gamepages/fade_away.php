                <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Fade away was a solo school project.
                        The project had as task to design a game from scratch using the subjects we learned troughout the classes.

                        The games main design point was of off the word "Fade" and made into a stealth game prototype.
                        One of the main design ideas was to make a stealth game with "world breaking" abilities, ablilities that makes it feel like you weren't playing the game as intended.

                        "Fade" instantly stood out to me as a word, with it i saw something like some fading out ghost or something fading away. which I found as something fun to make in something like a stealth game.

                        the first core mechanic diagram looked like this

                        With this concept a saw games like stealth games to be
